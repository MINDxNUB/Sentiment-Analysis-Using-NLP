Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews Using NLP

## Introduction
  Sentiment analysis, a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in textual data, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. This project focuses    on **Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews Using NLP**, leveraging deep learning techniques to classify reviews and provide meaningful insights into customer opinions.

  The primary dataset utilized for this project is the **IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset**, a large collection of labeled movie reviews. The project begins with a baseline analysis using **Logistic Regression**,          followed by the actual implementation of a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network**, an advanced deep learning model designed to handle sequential text data effectively. Additionally, a **Web application** is developed to provide an interactive interface where users can input reviews and receive sentiment predictions in real time.
